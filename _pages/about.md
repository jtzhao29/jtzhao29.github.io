I am a undergraduate majoring in Physics at Shanghai Jiaotong University, with a great interst in AI. 

See [Research interests](#research-interests) part for more information about what I am intersted. If you share a similar passion with me, feel free to reach out and connect with me!

<!-- ## Education
- BSc in Physics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, 2027 (Expected) -->

## Research interests

I mainly focus on how to enable models to emergently develop **generalized reasoning abilities at a sustainale scale with RL**. I believe that as the scale of systems increases, whether a model can emergently develop generalized reasoning abilities without relying on external supervision is a key step toward AGI. My research interests in this area include:

1. Emergent Reasoning Ability:
